1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    > Some included packages causes peer-deps issue with React 19 while installing.
    >
    > With npm the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is a workaround for that at the moment.

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
